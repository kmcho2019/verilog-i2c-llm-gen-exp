// LLM: Please complete the Verilog module logic below.
// The module should initialize I2C devices based on a predefined sequence
// stored in an internal ROM (init_data).
// It needs a state machine to manage the sequence of commands (address write, data write, delays).
// The module outputs AXI-Stream like commands (m_axis_cmd_*) and data (m_axis_data_*).
// The 'busy' signal should indicate when the module is active.
// Consider the command types: stop, exit multiple device mode, start write to current address,
// start address block, start data block, delay, send I2C stop, start write to address, and write 8-bit data.
// Ensure correct handling of m_axis_cmd_ready and m_axis_data_tready.

Generic module for I2C bus initialization.  Good for use when multiple devices
on an I2C bus must be initialized on system start without intervention of a
general-purpose processor.

Copy this file and change init_data and INIT_DATA_LEN as needed.

This module can be used in two modes: simple device initialization, or multiple
device initialization.  In multiple device mode, the same initialization sequence
can be performed on multiple different device addresses.

To use single device mode, only use the start write to address and write data commands.
The module will generate the I2C commands in sequential order.  Terminate the list
with a 0 entry.

To use the multiple device mode, use the start data and start address block commands
to set up lists of initialization data and device addresses.  The module enters
multiple device mode upon seeing a start data block command.  The module stores the
offset of the start of the data block and then skips ahead until it reaches a start
address block command.  The module will store the offset to the address block and
read the first address in the block.  Then it will jump back to the data block
and execute it, substituting the stored address for each current address write
command.  Upon reaching the start address block command, the module will read out the
next address and start again at the top of the data block.  If the module encounters
a start data block command while looking for an address, then it will store a new data
offset and then look for a start address block command.  Terminate the list with a 0
entry.  Normal address commands will operate normally inside a data block.

Commands:

00 0000000 : stop
00 0000001 : exit multiple device mode
00 0000011 : start write to current address
00 0001000 : start address block
00 0001001 : start data block
00 001dddd : delay 2**(16+d) cycles
00 1000001 : send I2C stop
01 aaaaaaa : start write to address
1 dddddddd : write 8-bit data
